  "readme": "# Gulp Bash Completion\n\n## Simple Usage\n\nYou have to do two things:\n- Add `gulp-bash-completion` to your `package.json`, require it somewhere in your gulpfile, and pass gulp into it.\n\n```javascript\n    var gulp = require('gulp');\n    require('gulp-bash-completion')(gulp);\n```\n\n- Copy `gulp-completion.bash` somewhere and source it in your shell.\n\n## More Usage\nYou can pass in an options object as the second argument to `gulp-bash-completion`'s exported function.  This only takes one option at the moment, `filter`.  It's used to filter tasks out of tab completion.\nThe default filter hides task names with a leading underscore, as well as the task added by `gulp-bash-completion` itself.\n\n```javascript\n    var gulp = require('gulp');\n    require('gulp-bash-completion')(gulp, {\n        filter: function(taskName) {\n            if (!(taskName === 'smurf')) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n    });\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n- The bash script creates a cache file `.gulp_tasks~` in the same directory as your gulpfile.  Add it to any relevant .ignore files.\n- Sometimes all the whitespace in Python makes me feel cold and empty.\n",
